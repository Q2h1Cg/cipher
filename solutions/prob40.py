# Assume you're a Javascript programmer. That is, you're using a
# naive handrolled RSA to encrypt without padding.

# Assume you can be coerced into encrypting the same plaintext
# three times, under three different public keys. You can; it's
# happened.

# Then an attacker can trivially decrypt your message, by:

# 1. Capturing any 3 of the ciphertexts and their corresponding pubkeys

# 2. Using the CRT to solve for the number represented by the three
# ciphertexts (which are residues mod their respective pubkeys)

# 3. Taking the cube root of the resulting number

# The CRT says you can take any number and represent it as the
# combination of a series of residues mod a series of moduli. In the
# three-residue case, you have:

def do_CRT(a_list, N_list):
    assert(len(a_list) >= 3);

    for i in range(3):
        (r,s) = egcd(N_list[i], N//N_list[i]);
        e = s*N//N_list[i];
        x += a_list[i] * e;
    return (x % N);
