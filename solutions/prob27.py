# Recover the key from CBC with IV=Key

# Take your code from the CBC exercise (16) and modify it so that it
# repurposes the key for CBC encryption as the IV. Applications
# sometimes use the key as an IV on the auspices that both the sender
# and the receiver have to know the key already, and can save some space
# by using it as both a key and an IV.

# Using the key as an IV is insecure; an attacker that can modify
# ciphertext in flight can get the receiver to decrypt a value that will
# reveal the key.

# The  CBC code from exercise 16 encrypts a URL string. Verify each byte
# of the plaintext for ASCII compliance (ie, look for high-ASCII
# values). Noncompliant messages should raise an exception or return an
# error that includes the decrypted plaintext (this happens all the time
# in real systems, for what it's worth).
