# Clone An MT19937 RNG From Its Output
from prob21 import MT19937

# The internal state of MT19937 consists of 624 32 bit integers.

# For each batch of 624 outputs, MT permutes that internal state. By
# permuting state regularly, MT19937 achieves a period of 2**19937,
# which is Big.

# Each time MT19937 is tapped, an element of its internal state is
# subjected to a tempering function that diffuses bits through the
# result.

# The tempering function is invertible; you can write an "untemper"
# function that takes an MT19937 output and transforms it back into the
# corresponding element of the MT19937 state array.

# To invert the temper transform, apply the inverse of each of the
# operations in the temper transform in reverse order. There are two
# kinds of operations in the temper transform each applied twice; one is
# an XOR against a right-shifted value, and the other is an XOR against
# a left-shifted value AND'd with a magic number. So you'll need code to
# invert the "right" and the "left" operation.

# so I can test w/o instantiating an MT:
