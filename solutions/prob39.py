# Implement RSA

# There are two annoying things about implementing RSA. Both of them
# involve key generation; the actual encryption/decryption in RSA is
# trivial.

# First, you need to generate random primes. You can't just agree on a
# prime ahead of time, like you do in DH. You can write this algorithm
# yourself, but I just cheat and use OpenSSL's BN library to do the
# work.

from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime
from prob33 import mypow
from prob1 import rawToHex, hexToRaw

def generatePrime(bits):
    return getPrime(bits);
    
    
# The second is that you need an "invmod" operation (the multiplicative
# inverse), which is not an operation that is wired into your
# language. The algorithm is just a couple lines, but I always lose an
# hour getting it to work.

# I recommend you not bother with primegen, but do take the time to get
# your own EGCD and invmod algorithm working.

Returns (x,y) such that (ax + by) = gcd(a,b)'''
def egcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        q = a // b;
        r = a % b;
        (s, t) = egcd(b, r)
        return (t, s - q * t)

# Returns a^-1 mod N
def invmod(a, N):
    # ax + by = 1:
    # ax - 1 = by

# Now:

# can just pick them out of a prime table. Call them "p" and "q".

#string to hex and put "0x" on the front of it to turn it into a
